            Aquatic Network started off as Corrupted Network, the name change was decided within a year after it was started. Aquatic Network, formerly known as Corrupted Network, used to have a realm but now it has a server after decisions made by staff. Aquatic started off after the decision to make it, at the time the members of staff were also staff for another server, this got the co owner of the other server angry. Not too long after this they were banned off the other server and have hated them ever since. They have been banned off the server many times. After they were banned, they carried on to upgrade the realm then server more and more until the state it is in today.
